Article Pages
=============

Create a blog

Usage
-----

First start by creating an "Article Landing Page" (may be named differently on your specific website). Add content to this page as usual. 

Under the **Layout** tab, you have the following new options:

* Show Images:  If toggled on, this landing page will show the cover images for it's children articles.
* Show Captions: If toggled on, this landing page will show the captions for it's children articles.
* Show Author and Date Info: If toggled on, this landing page will show the captions for it's children articles.
* Show Preview Text: If toggled on, this landing page will show a preview of it's childrens content.

Next, save the "Article Landing Page". Now create a child "Article Page". Each child page here represents an individual article.  Add content to this page as you would for a normal "Web Page".

Under the **Content** tab you have the following new options:

* Caption: The caption you want to be displayed under your article's title.
* Author: The user you want to tie the article to.
* Display Author As: The name you want the author to appear as.  This will default to the Author's name if not defined.
* Display Publish Date: The publish date you want to be shown on your article.  This is seperate from the actual publish date which is determined when the page is published.
